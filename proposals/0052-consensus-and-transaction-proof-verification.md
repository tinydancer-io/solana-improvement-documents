## Summary

This SIMD describes the changes required to allow users to
verify that a supermajority of the stake has voted on the slot that their
transaction was included in the block without fully trusting the RPC provider.

The main change includes:
  -  Modifying the bankhash to add a Receipt Root of the receipt merkle tree that
	  includes transaction signatures and statuses. 

## Motivation

Currently, for a user to validate whether their transaction is valid and included
in a block it needs to trust the confirmation from the RPC. This has been a glaring
attack vector for malicious actors that could lie to users if it's in their own interest.

To combat this, mature entities like exchanges run full nodes that process the
entire ledger and can verify entire blocks. The downside of this is that it's
very costly to run a full node which makes it inaccessible to everyday users,
exposing users to potential attacks from malicious nodes.
This is where diet clients come in, users run the client to verify
the confirmation of their transaction without trusting the RPC.

## Alternatives Considered

None

## New Terminology

Receipt: A structure containing transaction signature and its execution status.

Receipt Root: The root hash of a binary merkle tree of Receipts.

## Detailed Design

### Modifying the Bankhash

We propose two new changes:
1) The receipt data structure and the receipt merkle tree which is formally
   defined in this [SIMD]([https://github.com/tinydancer-io/solana-improvement-documents](https://github.com/tinydancer-io/solana-improvement-documents/blob/transaction-receipt/proposals/0064-transaction-receipt.md))
```rust
  pub struct Receipt {
    pub signature: [u8; 64],
    pub status: u8,
  }
```
2) Add a transaction receipt root to the bankhash calculation where the receipt
   root is the root of the merkle tree of receipts. This root would be a sha256
   hash constructed as a final result of the binary merkle tree of receipts.
   Specifically it will be a 32 byte array. The receipt root would be added to
   the bankhash as follows:
``` rust
  let mut hash = hashv(&[
  	self.parent_hash.as_ref(),
  	accounts_delta_hash.0.as_ref(),
  	receipt_root,
  	&signature_count_buf,
  	self.last_blockhash().as_ref(),
  ]);
```
Note: The second change would initially be feature gated with a flag and can 
be activated once we have enough stake on the network with this version of the client.

#### Benchmarks

We have performed benchmarks comparing two merkle tree implementations, 
the benchmark was done on 1 million leaves, each leaf consisted of a 64 byte signature and a single byte status.
1) Solana Labs Merkle Tree: This is the pure rust implementation that is currently used by the Solana Labs client.
   More details [Solana labs repository](https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/tree/master/merkle-tree)
3) Firedancer binary merkle tree (bmtree): Implemented in C and uses firedancer's
   optimised SHA-256 implementation as it's hashing algorithm. However the benchmarks were
   performed using its rust FFI bindings. More details: [Firedancer](https://github.com/firedancer-io/firedancer/tree/main/src/ballet/bmtree)

More details with an attached flamegraph can be found in our [repository](https://github.com/tinydancer-io/merkle-bench).

Despite the performance penalty of FFI we can still see that fd_bmtree32 is ~61%
faster than the pure rust implementation which makes it fast enough to not impact
consensus with decent headroom.

## Impact

This proposal will improve the overall security and decentralization of the Solana
network allowing users to access the blockchain in a trust minimized way unlike
traditionally where users had to fully trust their RPC providers. Dapp developers
don't have to make any changes as wallets can easily integrate the client making
it compatible with any dapp. 

The proposal would also be compatible with the future protocol updates like 
Bankless leaders since the tree construction would be done async by buffering 
transaction statuses. Bankless leaders won't need replay before propagating 
the block.

## Security Considerations


### Trust Assumptions and Future Work

While this SIMD greatly reduces the user's trust in an RPC, the light client will
 still need to make certain trust assumptions. This includes finding a trusted
 source for the validator set per epoch (including their pubkeys and stake weights)
 and trusting that all transactions are valid (in case the supermajority is corrupt).
 We plan to solve these problems in future SIMDs to provide a full trustless setup
 including data availability sampling and fraud proving which will only require a
 single honest full node.
